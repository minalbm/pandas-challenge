# pandas-challenge

In this repository you can find a folder called PyCitySchools. This folder includes a Resources folder which has the two datasets used in this challenge, as well as pyCitySchools.ipynb file which is the main code and a word document which has the summary and
the analysis of this assignment. 

Please NOTE: in the github preview, the summary and the analysis part which I saved does not show up but if you open the file in Jupyter Notebook, you can see it there or simply referr to the word document.

In order to solve this challenge I have used the lecture notes as well as the website mentioned below to calculate the number of unique schools:
